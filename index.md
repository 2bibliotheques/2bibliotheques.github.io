Welcome to the personal web site of Adam Hamilton. This will primarily serve as the home of writings that I have chosen to document in a publicly accessible weblog format. The ideas, advice, and moments that I intend to fix here are to serve manifold purposes for myself and for anyone who comes upon them. This repository is perhaps best described as a memorial—not only for the profundities herein captured, but for the immense grace of the God who has manifested them. It is highly recommended that the visitor reads my proper introduction to this web site in order to understand the full context in which its contents are shared. Along with frequent additions of writing, I intend to host complementary multimedia content and external hyperlinks that I find to be of interest.

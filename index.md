## Welcome to the Personal Weblog of Adam Hamilton
This is the repository for text or multimedia content that I am compelled document on the publicly accessible World Wide Web. The ideas, experiences, and advice that are captured herein may serve manifold purposes for myself in the future and for anyone who comes upon them. For better context, I highly recommend that new visitors read my proper ["Introduction to This Weblog"](https://2bibliotheques.github.io/2026/02/22/introduction.html). May this web site reflect a type of timeless serenity that natural spaces often hidden from modern life can impart. Such a quietness has spurred many of my writings after simply walking along a footpath.

## Acknowledgements
I am indebted to Chad Baldwin for his [Github weblog template](https://chadbaldwin.net/resume.html). It has provided me with a remarkable degree of autonomy and simplicity in putting this content online.
